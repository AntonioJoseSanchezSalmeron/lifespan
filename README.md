# lifespan
Lifespan automation for C. elegans cultured in standard Petri plates is a challenging problem because Petri plate edges present occlusions, worms can be aggregated, plates might accumulate dirt contamination (dust spots on the lid) during assays, and so on. This project presents two image-processing pipelines applied to different plate zones and a new data post-process method to solve these problems.
